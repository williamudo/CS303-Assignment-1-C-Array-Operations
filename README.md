# CS303 Assignment 1 â€” Array Operations in C++

This project aims to reads integers from a text file into a one-dimensional array (not a vector) and allows the user to:
  - Search for a number in the array
  - Modify a number at a given index (with error handling using exceptions)
  - Add a new number to the end of the array (with error handling using exceptions)
  - Remove a number from the array at a given index

# How to run:
  1. Compile code into preferred terminal (using g++):

     g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp functions.cpp -o main
     
  2. Run in terminal:

     ./main
